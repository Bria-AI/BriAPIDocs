    # Introduction

    The Bria API is designed to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for generating and customizing images. With Bria, you can:


    - **Generate Images Using Bria Models**: Utilize pre-trained Bria models to generate high-quality images based on text prompts.

    
    - **Train Your Own Tailored Models**: Create and manage custom-tailored models to generate images in specific styles or themes using your datasets.


    - **Enhance Product Imagery with E-commerce Solutions**: Use specialized features to create professional product shots, packshots, and lifestyle images for e-commerce platforms.

    
    - **Upload or Register Images**: Bring your own images into Bria and modify them using various routes to suit your needs.

    

    This document provides an overview of the API's capabilities and guides users on how to effectively implement them.


    ### Using Bria for Image Generation

    **Image Generation**:
    - Use the `/text-to-image` endpoints to generate any image you would like, based on the provided prompt, without needing to upload or register images first.

    **Tailored Generation**:
    The Tailored Generation API allows you to create and manage custom-tailored models for generating unique visual content based on your datasets. Tailored models can be trained using the API or through the Bria platform [here](https://platform.bria.ai/console/tailored-generation).


    **Using the Tailored Generation API**:
      - **Dataset Management**: 
        - Use the `/datasets` endpoint to create a new dataset or retrieve existing datasets that belong to the client organization.
        - Use the `/datasets/{dataset_id}/images` endpoint to upload new images to a dataset or retrieve existing images that belong to the dataset.
        - Use the `/datasets/{dataset_id}/images/{image_id}` endpoint to get or delete a specific image from a dataset.
      - **Model Management**: 
        - Use the `/models` endpoint to create a new model or retrieve all models that belong to the client organization.
        - Use the `/models/{id}` endpoint to retrieve a specific model by its ID or delete a specific model.
      - **Training Management**: 
        - Use the `/models/{id}/start_training` endpoint to initiate the training process. Ensure that the dataset includes the minimum required number of images and has a status of 'completed' before starting training.
        - Use the `/models/{id}/stop_training` endpoint to stop a training job for a model.

    **Training a Tailored Model**:
      1. Create a Dataset: Use the `/datasets` endpoint to create a dataset.
      2. Upload Images: Upload your images to this dataset using the `/datasets/{dataset_id}/images` endpoint.
      3. Create a Model: Use the `/models` endpoint to create a model associated with your dataset.
      4. Complete the Dataset: Ensure the dataset meets the minimum image requirements and change its status to 'completed'.
      5. Start Training: Initiate the training process using the `/models/{id}/start_training` endpoint.
      6. Monitor Training: Optionally, you can check the training status to monitor progress.
      7. Generate Images: Once the model is trained, use the `/text-to-image/tailored/{model_id}` route to generate images.

    ### E-commerce Solutions

    Bria offers a variety of solutions for products and apps in the e-commerce industry, which allow to enhance product imagery for online stores and product catalogs. These solutions include:
  
    - **Product Cutout**: Create clean and professional product cutouts.
    - **Product Packshot**: Generate professional-standard packshots with customizable background colors and optimal product placement.
    - **Lifestyle Shot by Text**: Enrich product images by placing them in various environments using textual descriptions, enhancing appeal and providing context.
    - **Lifestyle Shot by Image**: Generate product images in enriched environments using a reference image for inspiration, allowing for creative and unique presentations.

    
    ### Uploading and Modifying Images

    **Uploading and Registering Images**:

    
    - Use the `/register` endpoint to send a new image to Bria without being uploaded to the database. This is the recommended method to onboard images to Bria when needed.



    With the response from the *Upload/Register Routes* (visual_id), the following routes can be used without any particular order:
      - /campaign_generator - The *Campaign Generator Route* enables the creation of customized campaigns. It allows for the generation of visual ads, including various elements like text, images, and layout, based on specific parameters provided by the user.
      - /info - By using the *Info Route*, you can understand the possible changes for each object in the image. 
        The following routes can be used if you do not require information for people, objects, and background, but rather only one of them:
         - /person/info
         - /objects/info
         - /background/info
      - /increase_resolution - The *Increase Resolution route* is used to upscale any image. 
      - /image_to_psd - The *Image To PSD route* is used to create a layered PSD file out of any image.
      - /mask_generator - By using the *Mask Generator*, you can get all the available masks for an image, a segmentation for the image. 
      - /search - Utilizing the *Search Route* to look for images you uploaded or registered to Bria that match a text query. 
      - /search_similar_images - Utilizing the *Search Similar Images Route* to look for images you uploaded or registered to Bria that match the chosen image.
      - /caption - By using the *Caption Route*, you can get a caption that describes the given image.
      - /crop - The *Crop Route* is used to crop an image without a background, tightly around the remaining region of interest.

    With the response from the *Info Routes* or from the *Mask Generator*, the following routes can be used without any particular order:
      - /create - Using the *Create Route* to create a new visual with requested changes of elements according to the /info route possibilities. 
      - /objects/remove - Using the *Remove Object Route* to remove the objects from an image. You can also use this route with any mask, that is created manually by a user or generated by the /mask_generator endpoint.
      - /background/remove - Using the *Remove BG Route* to remove the background of an image.
      - /background/blur - Using the *Blur BG Route* to create a blur effect on the background of an image.
      - /replace_bg - Using the *Replace BG Route* to generate new backgrounds for an image.

        
    # Quality Predictions

    
    The "Oracle" capability within the API can significantly elevate the user experience by offering quality prediction functionalities. 

    
    With the Oracle integrated into your product, you can ensure optimal outcomes for your end users. 

    
    This feature covers various endpoints, including /create, objects/remove, and background operations, providing you with a range of quality prediction options to enhance your product's capabilities.

    
    The orcale value predicts the quality of the result, for each possible action.

    
    By using the "info" for all endpoints, "person/info" endpoint for face modifications, "objects/info" for object removal, and "background/info" for background actions, you can access the Oracle's predictions, and help your users to make informed decisions. 
    
    
    Incorporating Oracle predictions into the API workflow enhances efficiency, minimizes errors, and fosters an optimized API experience.   


    # Authentication

        **Description**
        

        The /text-to-image/fast Route is optimized for speed, enabling rapid image creation without compromising quality. This model allows for generating high-quality, photorealistic and artistic, images with a resolution of up to 1024x1024 pixels, supporting a variety of aspect ratios natively to accommodate diverse creative needs. 
        Ideal for applications requiring quick turnaround without sacrificing image fidelity.


        **Advanced Customization and Access:**


        Beyond the API, developers interested in deeper customization can access BRIA's models directly through Hugging Face. This alternative provides access to the underlying model source code, offering additional features such as ControlNets: <a href="https://huggingface.co/briaai/BRIA-2.3-ControlNet-Canny" target="_blank">Canny</a> , <a href="https://huggingface.co/briaai/BRIA-2.3-ControlNet-Depth" target="_blank">Depth</a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/briaai/BRIA-2.3-ControlNet-Recoloring" target="_blank">ReColoring</a>. This option is ideal for developers seeking advanced control over the image generation process and those who wish to integrate cutting-edge AI directly into their workflows.


        **An example:**


        **prompt**: A portrait of a Beautiful and playful ethereal singer, art deco, fantasy, intricate art deco golden designs, elegant, highly detailed, sharp focus, blurry background, teal and orange shades

      summary: Generate Image - Tailored model
      description: |-
        **Description**

        This route allows you to generate images using a tailored model. Tailored models are trained using your own datasets to create unique visual styles, character illustrations, or icons. You can train a tailored model through the API or using the Bria platform.

        ### Overview of Tailored Model API

        The Tailored Model API provides a set of endpoints to manage the entire lifecycle of a tailored model:

        1. **Dataset Management**: Create and manage datasets which will be used to train your tailored models. You can:
           - **Create and Retrieve Datasets**: Use the `/datasets` endpoint to create a new dataset or retrieve existing datasets that belong to the client organization.
           - **Upload and Retrieve Images**: Use the `/datasets/{dataset_id}/images` endpoint to upload a new image to a dataset or retrieve existing images that belong to the dataset.
           - **Manage Individual Images**: Use the `/datasets/{dataset_id}/images/{image_id}` endpoint to get or delete a specific image from a dataset.

        2. **Model Management**: Create and manage models based on your datasets. You can:
           - **Create and Retrieve Models**: Use the `/models` endpoint to create a new model or retrieve all models that belong to the client organization.
           - **Get and Delete Specific Models**: Use the `/models/{id}` endpoint to retrieve a specific model by its ID or delete a specific model.

        3. **Training Management**: Start and stop training jobs for your models. You can:
           - **Start Training**: Use the `/models/{id}/start_training` endpoint to initiate the training process. Note that the dataset must include the minimum required number of images and have a status of 'completed' before training can start.
           - **Stop Training**: Use the `/models/{id}/stop_training` endpoint to stop a training job for a model.

        ### Training a Tailored Model

        To train a tailored model via the API:
        1. **Create a Dataset**: Use the `/datasets` endpoint to create a dataset.
        2. **Upload Images**: Upload your images to this dataset using the `/datasets/{dataset_id}/images` endpoint.
        3. **Create a Model**: Use the `/models` endpoint to create a model associated with your dataset.
        4. **Complete the Dataset**: Ensure the dataset meets the minimum image requirements and change its status to 'completed'.
        5. **Start Training**: Initiate the training process using the `/models/{id}/start_training` endpoint. Training of a tailored model takes between 1-3 hours.
        6. **Monitor Training**: Optionally, you can check the training status to monitor progress.
        7. **Generate Images**: Once the model is trained, use this route to generate images.

        Alternatively, you can use the Bria platform to manage and train your tailored models through a user-friendly interface. Access the Bria platform [here](https://platform.bria.ai/console/tailored-generation).

      summary: Product Placement (Soon to be Deprecated)
      description: >-
        **Description**
  
        This route will be deprecated on 25/07/2024.
        
        
        The *Product Placement Route* is used to replace the background of a previously uploaded product image with a generated background. This endpoint is specifically tailored for product images, such as those used in consumer packaged goods (CPGs) and e-commerce.

  
        This route leverages the state-of-the-art BRIA 2.3 ControlNet BG-Gen model to place products in various contextual backgrounds, enhancing their appeal and relevance. It supports several use cases:

  
        1. **Catalog Enhancement/Contextual Backgrounds**: Place products in realistic or lifestyle settings that showcase how they can be used or worn. This helps customers visualize the product in real-life situations, increasing their desire to purchase.

        
        2. **Seasonal or Themed Backgrounds**: Change the background of product images to match seasonal promotions, holidays, or specific themes.

        
        3. **Artistic or Creative Backgrounds**: Use illustrations, patterns, or abstract designs that complement the product and appeal to your target audience.

  
        The key is to choose backgrounds that enhance the product's appearance, provide relevant context, and align with the brand's aesthetic. Ensure the backgrounds don't distract from the product itself, which should always remain the main focus of the image.

    
        This endpoint also supports solid colors - you can take a color code and use it in the prompt.

  
        Before making any modifications, please call the /info or background/info route to obtain information on the available modifications and their oracle values.

  
        Here are some examples:

  
        **original image**: 

        
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/V3NBMVJ/bria-d66969969696684b-4.jpg" width="200"/>

        
        **results**:

      summary: Register Image
      description: >-

        **Description**


        A new visual can be registered to Bria without being uploaded to the database using the *Register Route*.
        
        This route returns a visual identification to the user. This is the recommended method to onboard images to Bria, when needed.
        
        
        It's the first step for consuming the Bria API for new visuals (instead of using the /upload route).


        **Response**

          
          The visual id in the response of the *Register Route* must be kept by the
        user in order to query image info, modify the image and use the search routes.


        ```{ "visual_id": "9ea9a4d2d19977a7c" }```


        The *visual_id* in the response of the /upload route will be used for all
        other routes.
        Store the visual_id in your database and map it to your image identification method for easy reference


        **Bria generative Web tool**


        The registered visual can be seen and used in the Bria generative web tool
        in cases where the tool is licensed as part of the project.


        To do so, the user can access the following url:
        ```https://labs.bria.ai/gallery/{visual_id}```, where the *{visual_id}*
        comes from the response of the */upload route*.



        **Constraints**


        Files should not be larger than 12MB. The status code 413 will be returned if the file exceeds its
        maximum size.
        
        
        The Bria API currently supports only JPEG and PNG files in RGB, RGBA, or CMYK color modes. When the file is of a different type or color mode, the status code 415 will be returned.

        **Description**


        The *Info Route* is used to retrieve useful information on a specific
        visual that was previously uploaded or registered.

        
        Additionally, it provides the following:
        
        1) A description of each object and element within the scene 
        
        
        2) The available changes, which are supported by the Bria API for each object and element


        3) The Oracle value for each available change. The orcale value predicts the quality of the result, for each possible action. 
        
        The possible oracle values for object removal or background actions are true and false. 
        
        The possible values for person modification are high, medium, and low.

        **Description**


        The *Background/Info Route* is used to retrieve useful information on the background of a specific
        visual that was previously uploaded to the database.

        
        Additionally, it provides the following:

        
        1) The available background actions, which are supported by the Bria API.


        1) The Oracle value for each available action. The orcale value predicts the quality of the result, for each possible action. 
        
        The possible oracle values for background actions are true and false. 
               
        
        This route should be used instead of the main /info route when you are only interested in 
        the available actions for the background of the image. 
        With this route, you will save runtime by only obtaining information that is relevant to your needs.

        The possible oracle values for object actions are true and false. 
               
        
        This route should be used instead of the main /info route when you are only interested in 
        information and available actions for the objects in the image. 
        With this route, you will save runtime by only obtaining information that is relevant to your needs.

        **Description**


        The *Objects/Mask Generator Route* is used to generate all possible masks for an image.
        

        The response contains a zip file named as the visual_id of the provided image.
        
        
        There are k mask files in the zip, each named with the visual_id and mask_id.
        

        The zip file contains an additional file whose name ends with "panoptic". It's not an image, it's a panoptic map. It can be transformed into a regular matrix.
        
        
        Each point in the image (x,y) is mapped to the mask that applies to that point. In the panoptic map, each pixel's grayscale value includes the mask_id. 
        

        You can display those masks to the user, let them pick one or more masks, and use objects/remove route to remove the masked area.


        In order to use the objects/remove route on the mask the user selected, you should provide the mask_id, and use the paramter mask_source=generated.

        
        You can see below an example of the content of the zip:

        **Description**


        The *Person/Info Route* is used to retrieve useful information on the people in a specific
        visual that was previously uploaded to the database.

        
        Additionally, it provides a description of each person within the scene 
        along with its available changes, which are supported by the Bria API. 

        
        This route should be used instead of the main /info route when you are only interested in 
        information and available actions for the people in the image. 
        With this route, you will save time by only obtaining information that is relevant to your needs.

        **Description**



        The *Create Route* is used to create a new visual, based on the changes
        requested by the user for a previously uploaded visual.
        
        
        You can also use this route on a modified image by providing the sid from the response of the previously used route.


        This route returns both the URL and the sid associated with the updated image.


        Before making any modifications, please call the /info or person/info route to obtain information on the available presenters in the image, the available modifications, and their oracle values.


        You should always include all the required changes in the request if you want to use multiple changes on a single person. It is not supported to make one request on a person with one change, take the SId from the result, and then use it in another request with a different change.


        When you want to make changes on multiple people, you can make one request with all the desired changes on all the relevant people or make one request with all the desired changes on one person and then use the sid from the response in the request on the other person.

      summary: Remove Objects
      description: >-
        **Description**




        The *Remove Object Route* is used to remove objects or areas. 


        You can provide the area for removal in the following methods:
        

        
        1) Call the /mask_generator endpoint, display the masks to the user, allow them to select a mask, and then send the mask_id to the objects/remove endpoint. Under the example named generated mask, you can see an example of this type of request.



        2) Allow the user to create a mask manually (by using a brush, for example), and then send the mask_url to the objects/remove endpoint. Under the example named manual mask, you can see an example of this type of request. You can access the SDK that demonstrates how to implement a brush feature in your Interface via the following <a href="https://github.com/Bria-AI/js-api-sdk/blob/main/manual_brush_ui" target="_blank">link</a>.



        3) Get the possible objects for removal using the /info or objects/info endpoint, present them to the user, and allow them to select objects for removal using the object name. Send the id of the selected object to the objects/remove endpoint. Under the example named object, you can see an example of this type of request. Since it covers only very specific elements, rather than all the elements in the image, this method is less recomended than the two above.

        


        In one request, you may send multiple IDs of objects, or points, or masks for removal, but you cannot combine them in one request. For example, you cannot send a point and a mask_id at the same time. 


        You can also use this route on a modified image by providing the sid from the response of the previously used route.


        This route returns both the URL and the sid associated with the updated image.


        Before making any modifications, please call the /info or objects/info route to obtain information on the available predefined objects in the image, the available modifications, and their Oracle values. If you are using mask_url or positive_points there is no need to call the info routes.

      summary: Remove Background - Isolated
      description: >-

        **Description**


        The *Remove BG* Route can be used to remove the background of an image.


        **The main difference between the regular and this isolated background removal endpoint is that you can use this endpoint without uploading or registering the image to Bria.**



        **Constraints**
        
        
        The Bria API currently supports only JPEG and PNG files in RGB, RGBA, or CMYK color modes. When the file is of a different type or color mode, the status code 415 will be returned.

        
        **Remove the background from an image using the image file**

        
          In our documentation request example, we demonstrate how to remove the background from an image using the image URL.
          
          
          If you want to use an image from a file, follow the example below:

      
              import requests
      
              url = "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v1/background/remove"
      
              payload = {}
              files=[
                ('file',('image_name.jpeg',open('/path_to_local_file/image_name.jpeg','rb'),'image/jpeg'))
              ]
              headers = {
                'api_token': 'xxxx'
              }
      
              response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload, files=files)

        The *Replace BG Route* is used to replace the background of a previously uploaded image with a generated background using the state-of-the-art BRIA 2.3 ControlNet BG-Gen model (<a href="https://huggingface.co/briaai/BRIA-2.3-ControlNet-BG-Gen" target="_blank">available on Hugging Face</a>). This new version offers higher-quality backgrounds and more precise control compared to the previous BRIA 1.4-based model.
        
        This endpoint also supports solid colors - you can take a color code and use it in the prompt.

        Before making any modifications, please call the /info or background/info route to obtain information on the available modifications, and their oracle values.
        
        
        Here are some examples:

        In this way, you can create unique variations of your original image instead of cropping it into different aspect ratios and losing important details.
        
        
        **Optimal input range**
        
        
        ***Input Image Area:*** Ensure that the input image area is more than 15% of the canvas area to achieve optimal results.
        

        ***Canvas Size:*** The canvas size should be up to an area of 5000x5000 pixels.

      summary: Increase Resolution - Isolated
      description: >-


        **Description**



        The *Isolated Increase Resolution Route* is used to upsacle the resolution of any image.


        **The main difference between the regular and this isolated Increase Resolution endpoint is that you can use this endpoint without uploading or registering the image to Bria.**


        **Constraints**
        
        
        The Bria API currently supports only JPEG and PNG files in RGB, RGBA, or CMYK color modes. When the file is of a different type or color mode, the status code 415 will be returned. 
        
        
        It's possible to increase the resolution of an image up to a total area of 8192x8192 pixels.

        
        **Increase the Resolution of an image using the image file**

        
          In our documentation request example, we demonstrate how to Increase the Resolutio of an image using the image URL.
          
          
          If you want to use an image from a file, follow the example below:

      
              import requests
      
              url = "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v1/image/increase_resolution?desired_increase=2"
      
              payload = {}
              files=[
                ('file',('image_name.jpeg',open('/path_to_local_file/image_name.jpeg','rb'),'image/jpeg'))
              ]
              headers = {
                'api_token': 'xxxx'
              }
      
              response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload, files=files)
      
              print(response.text)

        **Description**



        The *Image to PSD Route* is used to create a layered PSD file from any image.
        
        
        The image is divided into different layers (depending on the image): a background layer with all identified objects removed, a foreground layer without the background, and a layer for each object. 

        
        You can also use this route on a modified image by providing the sid from the response of the previously used route.

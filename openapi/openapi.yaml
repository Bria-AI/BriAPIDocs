    # Introduction
    
    
    The Bria API is intended for users to interact with BriEngine and perform various operations, 
    such as generating new images, customizing uploaded images, and searching. 
    
    This document will provide an overview of the API's capabilities and guide users on how to effectively implement it.


    **The common use of the Bria API is according to the following order:**
      - /upload - By using the *Upload Route*, you can to upload a new image to Bria database.
      - /register - By using the *Register Route*, a new image can be sent to Bria without being uploaded to the database.
      - /info - By using the *Info Route*, you an understand the change possibilities for each object in the image. 
        The following routes can be used if you do not require information for people, objects, and background, but rather only one of them:
         - /person/info
         - /objects/info
         - /background/info
      - /caption - By using the *Caption Route*, you can get a caption that describes the given image.
      - /image/generate - By using the *Image Generate* route, you can generate any image you would like, based on the provided prompt.

    
    With the response from the *Upload/Register Routes* (visual_id), the following routes can be used without any particular order:
      - /search - Utilizing the *Search Route* to look for images you uploaded or registered to Bria that match a text query. 
      - /search_similar_images - Utilizing the *Search Similar Images Route* to look for images you uploaded or registered to Bria that match the chosen image.
      - /crop - The *Crop Route* is used to crop an image without a background, tightly around the remaining region of interest.
      - /increase_resolution - The *Increase Resolution route* is used to upsacle any image. 
      - /image_to_psd - The *Image To Psd route* is used to create a layered psd file out of any image.
      - /video - (Coming Soon) Using the *Video Route* to create a short video based on a single still image.

      
    With the response from the *Info Routes*, the following routes can be used without any particular order:
      - /create - Using the *Create Route* to create a new visual with requested changes of elements according to the /info route possibilities. 
      - /recast_model - Using the *Recast Model Route* to create a new variation of your image, while customizing a portrait to any profession/theme
      - /remove_object - Using the *Remove Object Route* to remove the objects from an image.
      - /remove_bg - Using the *Remove BG Route* to remove the background of a an image.
      - /blur_bg - Using the *Blur BG Route* to create a blur effect on the background of an image.
      - /replace_bg - Using the *Replace BG Route* to generate new backgrounds for an image.
      
        
      
      
    # Versioning


    The current version of the web API is known as V1 and is considered to be in
    a draft phase. While we don’t expect public endpoints to materially change,
    please bear in mind that the API is still under development.


    # Authentication

      The Bria API consists of a number of methods for uploading and creating new visual assets. The REST (representational state transfer) API methods can be called directly from within your own custom code.

        curl --location --request POST 'https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v1' \
        --header: 'api_token: <...>' \
        ...
        
    # API Access
    
      You can register and access the API Token through Bria's platform <a href="https://bria.ai/api-plans/" target="_blank">by clicking here</a>.

        **Description**


        The *Upload Route* is used to upload visuals to the database. 

        This route returns a visual identification to the user. It's
        the first step for consuming the Bria API for new visuals.


        **Response**

          
          The visual id in the response of the *Upload Route* must be kept by the
        user in order to query image info, modify the image and use the search routes.


        ```{ "visual_id": "9ea9a4d2d19977a7c" }```


        The *visual_id* in the response of the /upload route will be used for all
        other routes.
        Store the visual_id in your database and map it to your image identification method for easy reference


        **Bria generative Web tool**


        The uploaded visual can be seen and used in the Bria generative web tool
        in cases where the tool is licensed as part of the project.


        To do so, the user can access the following url:
        ```https://labs.bria.ai/tools/{visual_id}```, where the *{visual_id}*
        comes from the response of the */upload route*.


        In Bria's web tool, the user has the ability to make many changes to the
        visual and also generate live videos, using an intuitive interactive
        platform.


        Bria's web tool can also be embedded in other websites, with the use of
        an iframe HTML element:

        **Constraints**


        Files should not be larger than 12MB. The status code 413 will be returned if the file exceeds its
        maximum size.
        
        
        Bria API currently only supports JPEG and PNG files. The status code 415 will be returned if the file is of a different type.

        **Description**


        A new visual can be registered to Bria without being uploaded to the database using the *Register Route*.
        
        This route returns a visual identification to the user. 
        
        
        It's the first step for consuming the Bria API for new visuals (instead of using the /upload route).


        **Response**

          
          The visual id in the response of the *Register Route* must be kept by the
        user in order to query image info, modify the image and use the search routes.


        ```{ "visual_id": "9ea9a4d2d19977a7c" }```


        The *visual_id* in the response of the /upload route will be used for all
        other routes.
        Store the visual_id in your database and map it to your image identification method for easy reference


        **Bria generative Web tool**


        The registered visual can be seen and used in the Bria generative web tool
        in cases where the tool is licensed as part of the project.


        To do so, the user can access the following url:
        ```https://labs.bria.ai/tools/{visual_id}```, where the *{visual_id}*

        **Description**


        The *Info Route* is used to retrieve useful information on a specific
        visual that was previously uploaded to the database.

        
        Additionally, it provides a description of each object and element within the scene 
        along with its available changes, which are supported by the Bria API.

        **Description**


        The *Person/Info Route* is used to retrieve useful information on the people in a specific
        visual that was previously uploaded to the database.

        
        Additionally, it provides a description of each person within the scene 
        along with its available changes, which are supported by the Bria API. 
        
        This route should be used instead of the main /info route when you are only interested in 
        information and available actions for the people in the image. 
        With this route, you will save time by only obtaining information that is relevant to your needs.

        **Description**


        The *Objects/Info Route* is used to retrieve useful information on the objects in a specific
        visual that was previously uploaded to the database.

        
        Additionally, it provides a description of each object within the scene 
        along with its available changes, which are supported by the Bria API. 
        
        This route should be used instead of the main /info route when you are only interested in 
        information and available actions for the objects in the image. 
        With this route, you will save time by only obtaining information that is relevant to your needs.

        **Description**


        The *Background/Info Route* is used to retrieve useful information on the background of a specific
        visual that was previously uploaded to the database.

        
        Additionally, it provides the available changes for the background, which are supported by the Bria API. 
        
        This route should be used instead of the main /info route when you are only interested in 
        the available actions for the background of the image. 
        With this route, you will save time by only obtaining information that is relevant to your needs.

        This will enable you to create new and unique variations of your original image.
        
        
        Here are some examples:

        **Description**



        By using the *Search Route*, you can utilize Bria's generative search capabilities, which don't require labels or keywords.
        
        
        The user can send any text query and receive relevant images that match the query.
        
        
        The *Search Route* returns the images, sorted by the match score, from highest match to lowest match.
        
        The images are returned in batches, and you can specify how many images to receive in one batch, and which batch to receive in each call.

    The BriAPI was designed for users to interact with the Briengine, creating new images with specific requests. This document will outline the capabilities of the BriAPI and explain to users how to interact with it, step by step.
    
    
    The common process for consumption of the BriAPI, orderly placed, is as follows:
      - /upload - Using the upload route to upload a new image to the database
      - /info - Using the info route to clarify the possible actions for each element in the image
      - /create - Using the create route to create a new visual with requested changes to a previous one

    # Versioning


    The current version of the web API is known as V1 and is considered to be
    in a draft phase. While we don’t expect public endpoints to change greatly,
    keep in mind that the API is still under development.


    # Authentication
    
      The BriAPI consists of a number of methods for uploading and creating new visual assets. The REST API methods can be called directly from within your own custom code.

        curl --location --request POST 'https://briator-api.bria.ai:5000/v1' \
        --header: 'api_token: <...>' \
        --header: 'api_secret: <...>' \
        ...
        
        
      You can access the API Token and API Secret through Bria's platform [by clicking here](https://labs.bria.ai/organization/).
      
      
    # Demonstration of usage
      
      For a full example of the BriAPI usage, using python code, [please check this link](https://github.com/Bria-AI/BriAPI/blob/main/demo.py)

        **Description**
        
        
        The upload method is used to upload visuals to the database.
        
        
        In case of success, the upload route will return to the user a visual identification. The upload route is the first step for consuming the BriAPI for new visuals.
        

        **Response**


        visual_id - The visual id in the reponse of the upload route must be kept by the user in order to query image info and make changes to it


        ```{ "visual_id": "9ea9a4d2d19977a7c" }```
        
        
        The *visual_id* in the response of the /upload route can be used for the /info and /create routes, but also to access the Bria web tool with the uploaded visual.
        
        
        In order to do that, the user can access the following url: ```https://labs.bria.ai/tools/{visual_id}```, where the *{visual_id}* comes from the response of the */upload* route
        
        
        In Bria's web tool, the user has the ability to make many changes to the visual and also generate live videos, using an intuitive interactive platform.

        Bria's web tool can also be embedded in other websites, with the use of an iframe HTML element:
        
        
            <iframe src="https://labs.bria.ai/tools/{visual_id}" />
            
            
        <img src="https://bria-web-serving.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen+Shot+2021-08-01+at+15.14.22.png" />
        
        
        **Constrain**


        File should not be larger than 25mb

        **Description**
        
        
        The info method is used to retrieve useful information on a specific visual that was previously uploaded to the database.
        
        
        In case of success, the info route will return to the user a description of the scene and the possible actions for each element within it. 
        
        
        The info route will clarify the possible changes that the BriAPI supports for each element in the scene.
        

        
        **Response**


        Dict - A dictionary of relevant information about the required image. An object with JSON format, containing two key-value pairs:
        
          - **description**: a brief description of the visual
          - **scene**: an array of objects representing each of the elements recognized in the visual.
          
        Each object inside the *scene* array will contain:
          
          - **id**: the id of the specific individual
          - **labels**: an array with known information on the element, such as age range and gender
          - **actions**: an object containing the available changes for the */create* route.
          
        The *actions* object contains the following key-value pairs:
        
          - **age**: an array containing the available age modifications for the element. Example:
              
              
            { "age": [ "mid-20", "mid-40" ] }  *

              
              
          - **diversify**: an array containing the available ethnicity modifications for the element. Example:
              
              
            { "diversify": [ "africa", "brazil", "mexico" ] }  *

            
          - **glasses**: an array containing the available glasses modifications for the element. Example:
              
              
            { "glasses": [ "light", "none" ] }  *

            
          - **smile**: an array containing the available smile modifications for the element. Example:
              
              
            { "smile": [ "calm", "serious" ] }  *

        The create method is used to create a new visual based on a previously existing one and the changes requested by the user.
        
        
        In case of success, the create route will return the url for accessing the new generated image and the confidence that Bria has on the quality of the generated visual. 
        
        
        The create route is the way to interact with the Bria platform.

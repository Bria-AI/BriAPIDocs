    The Bria's API was designed for users to interact with the BriEngine, creating new images and videos with specific requests. This document will outline the capabilities of the API and explain to users how to implement it.
    
    
    **The common use of the Bria's API is according to the following order:**
      - /upload - Using the *Upload Route* to upload a new image to the database
      - /info - Using the *Info Route* to understand the modification possibilities for each element in the image 
      
      
      With the reponse from the *Info Route*, the following routes can be used without particular order:
      
      
      - /create - Using the *Create Route* to create a new visual with requested modifications of elements according to Info Route possibilities.   
      - /video - (coming soon) Using the *Video Route* to make a short video out of a single still image
        
        
      The following route can be used at any moment:
      - /generate - (coming soon) Using the *Generate Route* to generate a completely new visual without the need to upload a seed image
      
      
      
    # Bria API's supported values and responses


    This section of the documentation serves as a dictionary of the possible values to be used in the API routes.
    
    
    For applicability of each list of values, please attent yourself to each route of the API.
    
    
      For the **human** class, these are the relevant lists of values:
      - Age
      
      
         ["mid-20", "mid-40", "mid-60"]
         
         
      - Diversify
      
      
         ["original", "africa", "korea", "india", "japan", "sweden", "germany", "russia", "mexico", "brazil", "england", "spain", "france"]
         
         
      - Glasses
      
      
         ["light", "heavy", "none"]
         
         
      - Smile
      
      
         ["happy", "calm", "serious"]
    


    # Versioning


    The current version of the web API is known as V1 and is considered to be in a draft phase. While we donâ€™t expect public endpoints to materially change, please bear in mind that the API is still under development.


    # Authentication
    
      The Bria's API consists of a number of methods for uploading and creating new visual assets. The REST (representational state transfer) API methods can be called directly from within your own custom code.

        curl --location --request POST 'http://bria-api.com:5000/v1' \
        --header: 'api_token: <...>' \
        --header: 'api_secret: <...>' \
        ...
        
        
      You can access the API Token and API Secret through Bria's platform [by clicking here](https://labs.bria.ai/organization/).
      
      
    # Demonstration of usage
      
      For a full example of the Bria's API usage, using python code, [please check this link](https://github.com/Bria-AI/BriAPI/blob/main/demo.py)

        **Description**
        
        
        The *Upload Route* is used to upload visuals to the database.
        
        
        The *Upload Route* will return to the user a visual identification. It is the first step for consuming the Bria's API for new visuals.
        

        **Response**


        The visual id in the response of the *Upload Route* must be kept by the user in order to query image info and make changes to it


        ```{ "visual_id": "9ea9a4d2d19977a7c" }```
        
        
        The *visual_id* in the response of the /upload route can be used for all other routes.
        
        
        **Bria generative Web tool**

      
        The uploaded visual can be seen and used in the Bria generative web tool in cases where the tool is licensed as part of the project.
        
        
        In order to do that, the user can access the following url: ```https://labs.bria.ai/tools/{visual_id}```, where the *{visual_id}* comes from the response of the */upload route*
        
        
        In Bria's web tool, the user has the ability to make many changes to the visual and also generate live videos, using an intuitive interactive platform.


        Bria's web tool can also be embedded in other websites, with the use of an iframe HTML element:

        **Constrain**

        **Description**
        
        
        The *Info Route* is used to retrieve useful information on a specific visual that was previously uploaded to the database.
        
        
        The *Info Route* will return to the user a description of the scene and the possible actions for each element within it. 
        
        
        The *Info Route* will list the possible changes that the Bria's API supports for each element in the scene.
        

        
        **Response**


        Dictionary - Relevant information about the required image. An object with JSON format, containing two key-value pairs:
        
          - **description**: a brief description of the visual
          - **scene**: an array of objects representing each of the elements recognized in the visual.
          
        Each object inside the *scene* array will contain:
          
          - **id**: the id of the specific element
          - **class**: the class type of the element (human, object, etc)
          - **labels**: an array with known information on the element, such as age range and gender
          - **actions**: an object containing the available changes for the */create* route for this specific element, depending directly on its class and specificity
          
        The content of *actions* object will depend on the class of the element it refers to. The currently suported classes are listed below, with their respective possible actions:
        
        
        *Human class:*
        
          - **age**: an array containing the available age modifications for the element. Example:
              
              
             { "age": [ "mid-20", "mid-40" ] }

              
              
          - **diversify**: an array containing the available ethnicity modifications for the element. Example:

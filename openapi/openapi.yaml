    The Bria API was designed for users to interact with the BriEngine,
    creating new images and videos with specific requests. This document will
    outline the capabilities of the API and explain to users how to implement
    it.


    **The common use of the Bria API is according to the following order:**
      - /upload - (Coming Soon) Using the *Upload Route* to upload a new image to the database
      - /info - Using the *Info Route* to understand the change possibilities for each object in the image 
      
      
      With the response from the *Info Route*, the following routes can be used without any particular order:
      
      
      - /create - Using the *Create Route* to create a new visual with requested changes of elements according to the /info route possibilities.   
      - /video - (Coming Soon) Using the *Video Route* to make a short video based on a single still image.
      - /remove_bg - (Coming Soon) Using the *Remove BG Route* to remove the background of a stil image.
        
        
      The following route can be used at any moment:
      - /generate - (Coming Soon) Using the *Generate Route* to generate a completely new visual without the need to upload a seed image
      
 
    # Versioning


    The current version of the web API is known as V2 and is considered to be in
    a draft phase. While we donâ€™t expect public endpoints to materially change,
    please bear in mind that the API is still under development.


    # Authentication

      The Bria API consists of a number of methods for uploading and creating new visual assets. The REST (representational state transfer) API methods can be called directly from within your own custom code.

        curl --location --request POST 'http://bria-api.com:5000/v2' \
        --header: 'api_token: <...>' \
        --header: 'api_secret: <...>' \
        ...
        
        
      You can access the API Token and API Secret through Bria's platform <a href="https://labs.bria.ai/organization/" target="_blank">by clicking here</a>.
      
      
    # Demonstration of usage
      
      For a full example of the Bria API usage, using python code, <a href="https://github.com/Bria-AI/BriAPI/blob/main/demo_v2.py" target="_blank">please check this link</a>.

        **Description**


        The *Upload Route* is used to upload visuals to the database.


        The *Upload Route* will return a visual identification to the user. It's
        the first step for consuming the Bria API for new visuals.


        **Response**

          
          The visual id in the response of the *Upload Route* must be kept by the
        user in order to query image info and make changes to it


        ```{ "visual_id": "9ea9a4d2d19977a7c" }```


        The *visual_id* in the response of the /upload route can be used for all
        other routes.


        **Bria generative Web tool**


        The uploaded visual can be seen and used in the Bria generative web tool
        in cases where the tool is licensed as part of the project.


        To do so, the user can access the following url:
        ```https://labs.bria.ai/tools/{visual_id}```, where the *{visual_id}*
        comes from the response of the */upload route*.


        In Bria's web tool, the user has the ability to make many changes to the
        visual and also generate live videos, using an intuitive interactive
        platform.


        Bria's web tool can also be embedded in other websites, with the use of
        an iframe HTML element:
            
            
        <img src="https://bria-web-serving.s3.amazonaws.com/new_tool_29_03_2022.png" />


        **Constraints**


        Files should not be larger than 12MB. The status code 413 will be returned if the file exceeds its
        maximum size.
        
        
        There is currently only support for JPEG files in the Bria API.

        **Description**


        The *Info Route* is used to retrieve useful information on a specific
        visual that was previously uploaded to the database.


        The *Info Route* will return a description of the scene to the user and
        the possible actions for each element within it. 


        The *Info Route* will list the possible changes that the Bria API
        supports for each element in the scene.



        **Response**


        Dictionary - Relevant information about the required image. An object
        with JSON format, containing two key-value pairs:

          - **description**: a brief description of the visual
          - **scene**: an array of objects representing each of the elements recognized in the visual.
          
        Each object inside the *scene* array will contain:
          
          - **id**: the id of the specific element
          - **class**: the class type of the element (human, object, etc)

          - **actions**: an object containing the available changes for the */create* route for this specific element, depending directly on its class and specificity
          
        The content of the *actions* object will depend on the class of the element
        it refers to. The currently supported classes are listed below, with
        their respective possible actions:


        *Human class:*

        **Description**



        The *Create Route* is used to create a new visual, based on the changes
        requested by the user for a previously uploaded visual.


        The *Create Route* will return the url for accessing the new generated
        visual and the confidence that Bria has in the quality of the new
        visual.


        **Request body**


        - **changes**: the changes requested by the user to apply to the visual


        The change can be sent as an object containing the name and the value of
        the change, for example:


          ```{ key: "japan", value: 5}```


        or as a string containing the name of the change which will take the
        default value, for example:


          ```"japan"```


        **Response**


        image_res - url to the new created image


        confidence - string indicating the level of confidence Bria has in the
        quality of the created image

        **Description**



        TheÂ *Video Route*Â is used to create a new video, based on a previously uploaded single still image. 
        
        
        This route can also be used on an image that has been changed by the user using the /create route.
        
        
        TheÂ *Video Route*Â will return the URL for accessing the new generated video and the confidence that Bria has in the quality of this video.

  title: The Bria API
  version: '2'

    # Introduction
    
    
    The Bria API was designed for users to interact with the BriEngine,
    creating new images and videos with specific requests. This document will
    outline the capabilities of the API and explain to users how to implement
    it.


    **The common use of the Bria API is according to the following order:**
      - /upload - (Coming Soon) Using the *Upload Route* to upload a new image to the database
      - /info - Using the *Info Route* to understand the change possibilities for each object in the image 
    
    With the response from the *Upload Route*, the following routes can be used without any particular order:
      - /remove_bg - (Coming Soon) Using the *Remove BG Route* to remove the background of a stil image.
      - /video - (Coming Soon) Using the *Video Route* to make a short video based on a single still image.
      
    With the response from the *Info Route*, the following route can be used without any particular order:
      - /create - Using the *Create Route* to create a new visual with requested changes of elements according to the /info route possibilities. 
        
    The following route can be used at any moment:
      - /generate - (Coming Soon) Using the *Generate Route* to generate a completely new visual without the need to upload a seed image
      
      
      
    # Versioning


    The current version of the web API is known as V2 and is considered to be in
    a draft phase. While we don’t expect public endpoints to materially change,
    please bear in mind that the API is still under development.


    # Authentication

      The Bria API consists of a number of methods for uploading and creating new visual assets. The REST (representational state transfer) API methods can be called directly from within your own custom code.

        curl --location --request POST 'http://bria-api.com:5000/v2' \
        --header: 'api_token: <...>' \
        --header: 'api_secret: <...>' \
        ...
        
        
      You can access the API Token and API Secret through Bria's platform <a href="https://labs.bria.ai/organization/" target="_blank">by clicking here</a>.
      
      
    # Demonstration of usage
      
      For a full example of the Bria API usage, using python code, <a href="https://github.com/Bria-AI/BriAPI/blob/main/demo_v2.py" target="_blank">please check this link</a>.

        **Description**


        The *Upload Route* is used to upload visuals to the database.


        This route returns a visual identification to the user. It's
        the first step for consuming the Bria API for new visuals.


        **Response**

          
          The visual id in the response of the *Upload Route* must be kept by the
        user in order to query image info and make changes to it


        ```{ "visual_id": "9ea9a4d2d19977a7c" }```


        The *visual_id* in the response of the /upload route can be used for all
        other routes.


        **Bria generative Web tool**


        The uploaded visual can be seen and used in the Bria generative web tool
        in cases where the tool is licensed as part of the project.


        To do so, the user can access the following url:
        ```https://labs.bria.ai/tools/{visual_id}```, where the *{visual_id}*
        comes from the response of the */upload route*.


        In Bria's web tool, the user has the ability to make many changes to the
        visual and also generate live videos, using an intuitive interactive
        platform.


        Bria's web tool can also be embedded in other websites, with the use of
        an iframe HTML element:
            
            
        <img src="https://bria-web-serving.s3.amazonaws.com/new_tool_29_03_2022.png" />


        **Constraints**


        Files should not be larger than 12MB. The status code 413 will be returned if the file exceeds its
        maximum size.
        
        
        Bria API currently only supports JPEG files. The status code 415 will be returned if the file is of a different type.

        **Description**


        The *Info Route* is used to retrieve useful information on a specific
        visual that was previously uploaded to the database.

        
        Additionally, it provides a description of each object and element within the scene 
        along with its available changes, which are supported by the Bria API.
